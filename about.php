            <p>Hi there! My name is Caroline.</br></br>

            I just moved from Montreal to Ottawa last year with very little knowledge of the city. Honestly, based on everyone&#39s reactions when I told them I was moving to Ottawa, it sounded like a very boring place to live lol. But just in my first year living here, I&#39ve made some wonderful friends, met my loving partner, and discovered lots of new cool places. So join me and my partner on our adventures in Ottawa and come build your own as well!</p>
